 required to guarantee finding the number?

Q17

 Question

 There is a 100-story building from which I have to drop two eggs and do an experiment. And the test
 is that if I am standing on floor N, if I drop an egg from there, the egg will break, but if I drop an egg
 from floor N-1, the egg will not break.So how many minimum tests do I need to take to find this Nth
 floor?

 Solution
 14

 minimum number of coins in a set to make that happen.

Q20

 Question

 Out of 2000 packets of food for an Annual NYPD Event, 1 packet is poisoned by a serial killer to kill
 an agent to create chaos. The man in the suit, John Reese, gets this information that the event will
 occur after 10 hours and the poison is slow, so the death will occur after 5 hrs during the party, through
 Finch’s machine. He reaches the place with Detective Fuesco to stop that. But Fuesco reminded him
 that to determine the poisoned food through forensic will take about 12 to 13 hours within which the
 poison will begin its effect. So Reese asked the manager to bring a number of Guinea pigs to determine
 the poisoned food. What would be the minimum number of Guinea pigs required to determine the
 poisoned food?

 Solution
 11 guinea pigs.

 Clues

Q22

 Question

 Three friends need to reach Kolkata from Purulia, which is about 300km away in such a way, that they

 Purulia at around 8am? (Write answer as in a 24-hr digital clock format, eg, 13:30, 07:50 etc)
